Buckets is a mobile banking application that provides users with the ability to dynamically 'itemize' the checking account experience with new 'bucket' accounts which can be set to fill automatically.  

## Hypothesis

For most consumers the allure of the shopping experience is a constant presence.  Be it a new car, a vacation or simply new home decor consumers at all levels of the income spectrum are constantly looking ahead to their next luxury or non-vital purchase.  For our purposes lets refer to this constant presence as the 'want' purchase.  The biggest obstacle for the average consumer for his next 'want' purchase is the almighty bottom line: the personal checking account balance. 

Today as much as 70-75% of Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-lives-paycheck-to-paycheck-you-might-be-surprised/).  When it comes to 'want' purchases this majority is limited by their discretionary spending capacity.  The sole alternative financing option for millions of these individuals is the credit card purchase which inevitably tacks on an APR rate of up to 25%.  Sure it is wise to save money and plan for 'want' purchases but the dull monotone of this sort of initiating this sort of long-term planning directly contradicts the excitement of the real-time consumer desire for the 'want' purchase.  Be it on main street or online the consumer desire for their next purchase is in the now while financial planning does not.

Enter the Buckets mobile app which allows the user to use the impulses of his consumer desires and behavior organize and manage his personal finances.  The hypothesis of this application is that while most mobile banking users are reluctant to organize and plan long-term for 'want' purchases, they will be more inclined to impulsively organize their discretionary finances if their consumer desires and activity are utilized as a catalyst to this end and placed at the forefront of the mobile banking experience.  

Beyond this intitial 'Bucket' creation the app provides the user with the appeal regularly to maintain and adjust their ongoing 'Bucket' accounts on a regular basis over time.
